\subsection{System Context}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item May is a busy food truck owner and wants to keep track of the food that I have in the truck so I know what I need to stock in the truck each morning. Since I am so busy I need the GUI to be easy to use without having to click through lots of menus to do frequent tasks such as entering an order.
	\item I’m a food truck employee and I would like to quickly view the recipes.
	\item I’m a non-native English speaking food truck employee and I would like to enter orders into the program using icons and/or a GUI in my native language.
	\item I’m a customer and would like to view the menu listed from the food truck.
	\item I’m a food truck employee and I would like to know if the food truck has enough stock to make an order before taking payment from a customer.
	\item I’m a food truck employee serving a vegan customer and would like to be able to keep track of how many vegan items are in stock as well as other items for other dietary requirements.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Relevant Business Information}
The food truck owner(s) would want to pay for us to develop this PUPOFS as it would save time and money organising and estimating inventory levels, which can lead to the prevention of shortages in stock, or lots of spoilt food.
